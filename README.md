# Youtube-API-Analysis

### Project Goal:
The idea of this project is to connect to the Youtube API to get relevant information about channels and videos and to analyze the collected information

### Section 1
I got information about 30 most relevant channels in Youtube, getting stats such as Views, Subscribers and Total Videos

In the exploratory analysis of this information we can see that Mr Beast is the channel with the most Subscribers whereas Like Nastya is the channel with the most views.

We can also confirm that the features Subscriptors and Views are positevely correlated, meaning that when the amount of subscribers of a channel increases, the amount of views of the channel also increases.

### Section 2 and 3
In the next sections of the project, I took a sample of 5 channels used in the previous section to get all the video ids of them. Then, I collected information of each of those video ids.
